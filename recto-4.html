	<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 72pt">Once, Jack and Lizzie told me that they were taking some pictures in the freight elevator behind the gallery for Lizzie’s Depop very late one Saturday when the freight elevator suddenly and without any prompting, descended. The claim is that they ended up in some sort of basement storage facility below Little Broad. I pictured it as the art school version of those storage units where they saw off the locks of storage units to see what they can find. According to Jack and Lizzie, they were stuck in this basement, as the elevator would not go back up, and they wandered around until they found some stairs that let them out somewhere near The School of Public Affairs (across the sculpture garden, quite far away).
