		<p style="margin: 0pt 12pt 0pt 72pt">Once years ago, Jack and Lizzie told me that they <br> 
		were taking some pictures in the freight elevator <br>behind the gallery for 
		Lizzie’s Depop very late one <br>Saturday when the  elevator suddenly 
		and without <br>any prompting, descended. The story goes that <br>they ended up in 
		some sort of basement storage <br>facility below Little Broad. I pictured this <br>basement 
		as the art-school version of those TV <br>shows where they saw off the 
		locks of storage <br>units to see what they can find— who <br>knows what was down there. <br><br>According to Jack and 
		Lizzie, they were stuck in <br>this basement, as the elevator would not go back <br>
		up, and they wandered around (tunnels, perhaps) <br>until they found some stairs that let them out <br>
		somewhere near The School of Public Affairs— <br>across the sculpture garden, quite far away,<br> indeed.
